**In this Script, I will develop a python program that is able to perform unsupervised clustering of data on the customer’s records from a groceries firm’s database
(`Hierarchical Agglomerative`, `KMeans`, `Gaussian Mixtures`, and `DBSCAN`). Customer segmentation is the practice of separating customers into groups that reflect similarities among customers in each cluster. I will divide customers into segments to optimize the significance of each customer to the business. To modify products according to the distinct needs and behaviors of the customers. It also helps the business to cater to the concerns of different types of customers.**
